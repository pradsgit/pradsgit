# Hey, I'm Pradeep 👋

Full-stack engineer (6+ years) now focused on AI infrastructure and LLM systems.

I've built zero-to-one products at early-stage startups: marketplaces, booking systems, mobile apps. Now I'm going deeper on the AI side: inference optimization, model internals, and building AI-native applications.

## What I'm working on

- **[nano-vllm](https://github.com/pradsgit/nano-vllm)** — Lightweight vLLM implementation for learning LLM inference internals
- **[llm-scratch](https://github.com/pradsgit/llm-scratch)** — Building LLM components from scratch (tokenizers, attention, training loops)
- **[transformer-from-scratch](https://github.com/pradsgit/transformer-from-scratch)** — Clean transformer implementation in PyTorch
- **[gpt2-pytorch](https://github.com/pradsgit/gpt2-pytorch)** — GPT-2 reimplementation for understanding autoregressive LMs

## Background

**Lead Full-Stack Engineer @ AdventureTripr** (2023-present)  
Architected React/Next.js frontend + Node.js/PostgreSQL backend for travel marketplace.

**Senior Software Engineer @ LeadSchool** (2021-2022)
